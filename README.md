Mom, Dad, is it gonna be hot or cold, what should I wear, do i have gym today?

Tired of your kids asking you what's the weather, what should I wear?
Or maybe they get up in the morning in middle of winter on a 32 degree
day and come to breakfast wearing a t-shirt and shorts.  This aims to
solve the problem by over-engineering as much as possible.

First version uses pygame and python.  Runs on laptop or a raspberry
pi with 7" touch screen.  I'm not happy with it. Really hard to
maintain and remember what I did.  It also started to freeze after
running for a few days/weeks.
